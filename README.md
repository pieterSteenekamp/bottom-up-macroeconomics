Using Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) to Explore Macroeconomics from the Bottom Up

This is an early interim step in the development of an agent-based model of macroeconomics—built from the bottom up—to help capture the complex and often unexpected behaviors that emerge in economic systems. While far from perfect, the goal is to gain at least some insight into the non-intuitive dynamics of real-world economies.

The model is implemented in Python using the Mesa ABM library.

Its broader purpose is to explore questions such as:

What macroeconomic choices lead to greater happiness in different types of societies?

How do fiscal and monetary policies impact long-term well-being?

How does international trade between unequal countries affect both parties?

In this initial version, countries, businesses, and citizens (the “agents”) are set up randomly. Although the simulation runs and produces output, the results are still largely noise and should not yet be taken seriously.

While the high-level design is entirely my own—something current AI cannot yet replicate—I gratefully acknowledge the detailed coding support provided by several free AI tools. These "assistants" have been invaluable in bringing the project this far. Thanks to:
