Proof of Concept (Toy Model): Agent-Based Model of Macroeconomic Choices and Citizen Happiness

Introduction

The macroeconomy is a complex, emergent system, and conventional top-down modeling approaches are often ill-suited for capturing its dynamic and adaptive nature. Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), by contrast, is better equipped to simulate such systems from the bottom up.
This project presents a simple ABM "toy model" that explores the relationship between macroeconomic decisions and citizen happiness. The underlying idea is that economic indicators are merely proxies — tools for achieving what should be the ultimate goal of macroeconomic policy: the well-being of citizens. It's clearly suboptimal if everyone is wealthy but miserable. At the same time, economic prosperity undeniably plays a key role in overall happiness.

Purpose of the Model

This is not intended to be a comprehensive or fully functional macroeconomic model. Rather, it serves as a proof of concept — a toy model that demonstrates, in principle, how we might simulate and explore the dynamic interplay between macroeconomic policy, international trade, cultural factors, and citizen happiness.

The model is designed to help explore important and complex questions such as:
•	What kinds of macroeconomic choices lead to greater happiness in different types of societies?
•	How do fiscal and monetary policies affect long-term well-being?
•	How does international trade between unequal countries impact both sides?

Despite its simplicity, a model like this has significant value. In any discussion of macroeconomic policy, people bring their own informal mental models of how the economy should behave. A transparent, working model makes it easier to see the assumptions driving outcomes. While disagreements may persist, it's productive to identify and debate these underlying assumptions explicitly.

Gratitude to AI

In developing this model, I made extensive use of several AI platforms. The conceptual framework and core ideas are my own, but I’m deeply grateful for the support and insights provided by the following tools:
